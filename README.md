This project was done as part of NASA Space Apps Challenge 2023 at hosted at Chandigarh University by SUMVN

ABOUT THE CHALLENGE
NASA offers a variety of “sonifications” – translations of 2D astronomical data into sound –that provide a new way to experience imagery and other information from space. Advanced instruments currently provide hyperspectral (many color) images from space that are 3D (two spatial dimensions and one color dimension), and sophisticated techniques can be used to enhance 2D astronomical images to make video representations called “fly-throughs” that allow viewers to experience what it would look like to move among space objects in 3D (three simulated spatial dimensions). Your challenge is to design a method to create sonifications of these 3D NASA space datasets to provide a different perceptual path that can help us understand and appreciate the wonders of the universe!
